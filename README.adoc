= Easy remote file storage (ezRFS)

Extremely simple remote file storage.

It is used for short-term storage of a file in a weak cloud VPS and accessible from the Internet.

- There is no database, everything is stored in the file system (easy local file storage (ezlfs) library)
- 2 operations: POST and GET
- without authorization (I'll probably do it by POST)
- files are automatically deleted by cron via linux find & rm
